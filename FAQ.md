# FAQ

These are the most frequently asked questions. I've tried to go into as much detail as possible for each question.

## What scenarios would require me to make a new save and why?

- Every X.0.0 update (ex. 2.0.0)
- Every 2.X.0 update (ex. 2.1.0 or 2.2.0)
- 2.1.X are the only updates that *don't* require new saves.
- Disabling BodyGen (or really any mod in the list.)

To clarify, if you're updating from any 1.X.X version to the current version you *NEED* to make a new save.
If you are updating from any 2.X.X update to a 2.X.0 update you *NEED* to make a new save.
If you're still unsure read the annoucement for the update. If it says it requires a new save then it does, vice versa.

Why? Because mods often intertwine within your save files. If I remove something the game will keep acting as if everything is still there and the game will crash when it tries to reference it. Disabling BodyGen mid save doesn't work because the values for all of their bodies are saved within your save file not within the mod. As for when I add mods the answer is simple, most of the time the game will not properly initialize them.

## Why isn't X mod included?

**Followers:** No reason actually, feel free to ping me in [my discord](https://discord.com/invite/XTfvnAh) with follower suggestions and I'll probably add them. I have Daedric Bitches and that's all I really care about lol

**Book of UUNP:** I'm thinking about it but there's also an annoying incompatiblity with another mod in the list. No promises.

**Immersive Armors:** Immersive Armors isn't included for many reasons, the main ones are: No native CBBE support, no unofficial 3BBB conversions and quite a few armors that I don't like.

**SexLab Defeat:** VERY buggy and I'm not into necrophilia or BDSM. No chances this will ever get added, sorry. Going to add [YeOlde - Respawn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26691) instead at some point.

**Creature Support for SexLab:** I'm not into bestiality and it would probably mean the sacrifice of poser mods. Not completely off the table but don't expect this until like 3.0.0 (several months away)

**VioLens:** It's planned.

**Other armors and outfits with 3BBB support:** I probably know about them and they're planned for a future update. Put them in the suggestions channel in [my discord](https://discord.com/invite/XTfvnAh).

**Needs/survival mods:** Most people find them annoying from what I can tell so I didn't add one. Especially felt out of place since this list wasn't ever really intended for normal gameplay up until a few months ago. If you're going to add one (despite forfieting official support) then use [Immersive Needs - For The Conscientious Modder](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29317). Don't even try iNeed.

## WTF is BodyGen???

Simple answer: It is randomized bodyshapes for NPCs. It's the reason why you're not supposed to change BodySlides. The randomized body shapes are built off of the base shape and you can't change it. If you touch BodySlides at all in the middle of a save that had BodyGen enabled at any point then your save will break and everyone will be super thicc. It's enabled by default and it's the intended way to play Cupid.

Technical answer: It applies racemenu body presets to females in the game randomly. It's based off of the presets that are in the list. It builds these bodyshapes *on top of* the default body shape. So if you change the default bodyshape and disable BodyGen midsave you'd essentially make everyone twice as thicc permanently because BodyGen hooks into your save. Do not do this.

You can alternatively disable the BodyGen mod in Mod Organizer ***BEFORE*** starting a save and build BodySlides to the way you'd like. However this has the obvious side effect of giving everyone the same body shape.

## How do I have sex? 

You can start sex through dialogue options, should work on most NPCs. You can force sex through the 2 SexLab debug spells that you spawn with. Sex will also randomly occur based off of the arousal levels of you and the NPCs around you (however you can disable this by unchecking "Player is Allowed." in the ABMM MCM.)

**Other important SexLab controls:**

Press `H` to bring up a menu of animations to select the one you want; sex started through dialogue or the arousal based matchmaking will be limited in this regard. `C and Shift + C` will adjust the angle of the schlong in the animation (it will often be misaligned unfortunately.) `; and :` will adjust the vertical position of (usually) the male in the scene (useful for additional alignment.) Press `[` to fix massive misalignments or characters stuck in T-poses. Press `]` to completely reposition an entire sex scene. `Space` will progress through the animation.

## Any other keybinds I should know about?

Yes, you should have set some of them yourself like the grip change button for CGO (which switches you between a one-handed or two-handed grip regardless of the weapon you're using. It's similar to Dark Souls.) L will toggle a light above you. Crouch is dodge (while moving) and that's about it.
