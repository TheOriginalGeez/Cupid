# FAQ

These are the most frequently asked questions. I've tried to go into as much detail as possible for each question.

## What scenarios would require me to make a new save and why?

Always assume that you need to start a new save if you update. An update to a list of mods is very different from a update to any other game.

I will be sure to make note in the annoucement for an update in the unlikely event that an update will be 100% save compatible with the previous version.

Why is Skyrim like this? It's because mods often intertwine within your save files. If I remove something the game will keep acting as if everything is still there and the game will crash when it tries to reference it. As for when I add mods the answer is simple, most of the time the game will not properly initialize them.

## Why isn't X mod included?

**X Follower Mod:** I've added every follower I was ever suggested. Most if not all of the popular ones should be in the list. It's unlikely I would add anymore at this point but I still encourage you to suggest it anyways, you might find yourself pleasantly surprised!

**Immersive Armors:** Immersive Armors isn't included for many reasons, the main ones are: No native CBBE support, no unofficial 3BBB conversions and quite a few armors that I don't like.

**SexLab Defeat:** VERY buggy and I'm not into necrophilia or BDSM. No chances this will ever get added, sorry. There is a SFW alternative included called [YeOlde - Respawn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26691) that you can use if you need the respawn feature.

**Creature Support for SexLab:** Never happening, bottom line I'm just not into it and I don't want it in the list sorry.

**Other armors and outfits with 3BBB support:** At this point I've added everything that I wanted to add. If there is a big clothing pack out there that's not in my list I probably know about it and it's not in my list for a specific reason ranging from QoL issues to broken clothes.

**Needs/survival mods:** I would love to add one but 40% of my polled users didn't want it added.  If you're going to add one (despite forfieting official support) then use [Immersive Needs - For The Conscientious Modder](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29317). Don't even try iNeed.

## How do I have sex? 

You can start sex through dialogue options, should work on most NPCs. You can force sex through the MassMatchMaker spells that you start with. Sex will also randomly occur based off of the arousal levels of you and the NPCs around you (however you can disable this by unchecking "Player is Allowed." in the ABMM MCM.)

**Other important SexLab controls:**

Press `H` to bring up a menu of animations to select the one you want; sex started through dialogue or the arousal based matchmaking will be limited in this regard. `C and Shift + C` will adjust the angle of the schlong in the animation (it will often be misaligned unfortunately.) `; and :` will adjust the vertical position of (usually) the male in the scene (useful for additional alignment.) Press `[` to fix massive misalignments or characters stuck in T-poses. Press `]` to completely reposition an entire sex scene. `Space` will progress through the animation.

## Any other keybinds I should know about?

Yes, you should have set some of them yourself like the sneak button in the TUDM MCM and the dodge button which should be whatever you have set to "Sneak" in the control settings. L will toggle a light above you. Read below for posing hotkeys.

## How to pose yourself and NPCs

First, select a pose from the poser menu by pressing `0`.

Next, play the pose by pressing `Home`.

You can use the arrow keys to cycle between poses.

To stop a pose press `End` or just jump.

Same hotkeys apply for NPCs just press `Home` while your crosshair is targetted at the NPC you wish to apply it to.
